                    Well, lets talk about me!!!!
                    Graduated as EC engineer 2022 batch from Vemana Institute of Technology. Technology enthusiast, attended several workshops on various technologies including industrial automation , web development and Open source EDA tools.
                    I've also completely a few global certifications such REDHAT as a system administrator and Cadence Innovus certifications, also have completed national certification from nptel in c and cp programming. After being placed in more than 3 companies in campus, I chose Semiconductor field since that fascinated me more other industries.
                    Now as of my extra curriculars, I've cycled more than 1000kms and participated in couple cyclathons and have written and published more than 50 poems as of now.
